Design Thought process

- Minimalistic design 
  - Minimalist design looks nice and clean 
  - Reduce the unnecessary things in the websites

- Responsive
  - All websites should be responsive as everybody will be viewing the website with different devices

- Dark Mode
  - Personally like dark mode as dark mode is easier for the eyes 

Method:
1. I designed my portfolio using Figma [https://www.figma.com/file/1N24Oeys6Zy2ZlGsKQm9Fd/New-portfolio-design?node-id=0%3A1]
2. Code the layout and styling using css
